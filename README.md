# Art of Java study

## Readme!
I studied chapter 2 to 7 of the book and added functions to expand it.
The contents of my analysis of the code were organized into pptx files.  
A description of the extended part of the code is also in pptx.  

## ‚òë Please refer to it's
There are also chapters that need to be corrected because there are some errors in the code of the book.  
Perhaps because the book has been published for a long time, especially the web-related part has a lot to be corrected.
